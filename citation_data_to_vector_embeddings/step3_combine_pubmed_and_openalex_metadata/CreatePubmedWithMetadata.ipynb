Each may have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients. Currently, there does not exist a noninvasive biological marker that enables differentiation between myelin and axonal injury. We describe herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to quantify the effect of dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities in brains of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion eigenvalues of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be identified with certainty on DTI maps were measured. The water diffusivity perpendicular to axonal fiber tracts, lambda(perpendicular), was significantly higher in shiverer mice compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the lack of myelin and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion in white matter. The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts, lambda(parallel), was not different, which is consistent with the presence of intact axons. It is clear that dysmyelination alone does not impact lambda(parallel). The presence of intact axons in the setting of incomplete myelination was confirmed by electron microscopy. Although further validation is still needed, our finding suggests that changes in lambda(perpendicular) and lambda(parallel) may potentially be used to differentiate myelin loss versus axonal injury.', publication_year=2002, cited_by_count=2355)"

A total of 363 primary sampling units (188 urban, 175 rural), in three states (Tamilnadu, Maharashtra and Jharkhand) and one union territory (Chandigarh) of India were sampled using a stratified multistage sampling design to survey individuals aged ≥20 years. The prevalence rates of diabetes and prediabetes were assessed by measurement of fasting and 2 h post glucose load capillary blood glucose. Of the 16,607 individuals selected for the study, 14,277 (86%) participated, of whom 13,055 gave blood samples. The weighted prevalence of diabetes (both known and newly diagnosed) was 10.4% in Tamilnadu, 8.4% in Maharashtra, 5.3% in Jharkhand, and 13.6% in Chandigarh. The prevalences of prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) were 8.3%, 12.8%, 8.1% and 14.6% respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, male sex, family history of diabetes, urban residence, abdominal obesity, generalised obesity, hypertension and income status were significantly associated with diabetes. Significant risk factors for prediabetes were age, family history of diabetes, abdominal obesity, hypertension and income status. We estimate that, in 2011, Maharashtra will have 6 million individuals with diabetes and 9.2 million with prediabetes, Tamilnadu will have 4.8 million with diabetes and 3.9 million with prediabetes, Jharkhand will have 0.96 million with diabetes and 1.5 million with prediabetes, and Chandigarh will have 0.12 million with diabetes and 0.13 million with prediabetes.

       "'Abstract Proteins, made up of either single or multiple chains, are designed to carry out specific biological functions. We found an interesting example of a two-chain protein where administration of one of its chains leads to a diametrically opposite outcome than that reported for the full-length protein. Clusterin is a highly glycosylated protein consisting of two chains, α- and β-clusterin. We have investigated the conformational features, cellular localization, lipid accumulation, in vivo effects and histological changes upon administration of recombinant individual chains of clusterin. We demonstrate that recombinant α- and β-chains exhibit structural and functional differences and differ in their sub-cellular localization. Full-length clusterin is known to lower lipid levels. In contrast, we find that β-chain-treated cells accumulate 2-fold more lipid than controls. Interestingly, α-chain-treated cells do not show such increase. Rabbits injected with β-chain, but not α-chain, show ~40% increase in weight, with adipocyte hypertrophy, liver and kidney steatosis. Many, sometimes contrasting, roles are ascribed to clusterin in obesity, metabolic syndrome and related conditions. Our findings of differential localization and activities of individual chains of clusterin should help in understanding better the roles of clusterin in metabolism.'"
